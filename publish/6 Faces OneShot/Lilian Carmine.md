- A paladin to Kelemvor. Has a very sensitive nose that can smell when death is in the air. After the cube’s fall into the sword coast seas Lilia has been hard at work filling her funeral home with even more flowers than before in a fruitless attempt to mask the smell.
- Her old helm lays unused on her desk. She has repurposed it into a flower pot.
- Lilia is currently living on the grounds of the local church of Lathander. She is tasked with assisting them with the upkeep of the grounds. Her home doubles as a funeral home. 
- When [[Viviane]] settled down within this town to spread her faith onto others, Lilian followed her.
