[[Symark Fletcher - Stats]]

*Renamed from Simar*
Captain of the Nightingalle

As the heir to a minor Drow noble house, Symark has long been tied down by the cultural standards of her heritage. Still, her escapades as a successful sea captain within overworld waters has allowed her to fulfill her duties as an heir while exercising a level of freedom for herself and her crew that would be impossible for them to achieve within the underdark. While operating under the guise of slaves, much of her crew is genuinely loyal to Symark as their captain, and many of them would go as far as to consider them her friends. In turn, Symark treats her crew with care and respect, and provides them with far superior amenities than what is expected of her as their master.

Recently, Symark has enlisted her youngest brother, [[Sybil Fletcher]], as the newest member of her crew. Having saved him as a baby from his fate as a third son, Sybil was raised on his sister’s ship and only recently began operating as an official part of the crew.
Shortly after boarding the cube, Symark’s liege killed himself to prevent himself from being added to Vargo’s hivemind.
Perhaps some members of Symark’s crew survived the onslaught and are set up in town, trying to prepare their voyage back to the cube.
