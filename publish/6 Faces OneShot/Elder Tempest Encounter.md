An [Elder Tempest](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/elder-tempest) flies onto the surrounding region. The party must attempt to navigate their way out of it. There will be an initial DC 8 Perception check to notice the clouds, and a DC 12 survival check to recognize the storm ahead as a rapidly approaching threat. If they fail to notice this by the time the rains are upon them, they will have no chance 

**Immediate observable effects:**
*  Sudden Atmospheric Pressure Drop
	* People might feel a popping in their ears.
	* Sensitive animals grow agitated (birds flee inland en masse).
	* Barometers plummet wildly.
* Immediate Darkening of the Sky
	* Clear blue skies darken in minutes.
	* Clouds form unnaturally fast—rolling in from all directions, spiraling toward a central vortex above the Elder Tempest.
	* Lightning flickers within cloudbanks before thunder is even heard.
* Violent Wind Surge 
	* A loud creak.
	* Winds shift direction 
	* Loose items become airborne instantly.
		  

**As the Elder Tempest approaches:**

> **Living Storm.** The tempest is always at the center of a storm 1d6 + 4 miles in diameter. Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes **disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.** In addition, strong winds swirl in the area covered by the storm. The winds impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. The winds extinguish open flames and disperse fog.

* The sky is completely occluded—midday becomes midnight.
*  A massive vortex forms overhead, centered on the Elder Tempest.
* Lightning strikes become nearly continuous, sometimes striking in branching fractals.
* Tornadoes may peel off the main storm like snapping whips.
* smaller elementals flee from the storms heart.

**In initiative:** 
Players must move to make a survival or vehicle proficiency check to navigate their way through the storm. Failure to do so will count as an automatic f

*3 Successful survival checks will allow the party to escape the Elder Tempest. 

*3 Failed checks will put it within it's 120ft range, triggering it's Lightning Storm Ability*


**Also in initiative:**

A pack of[air elementals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16774-air-elemental) spawn at the top of the round. The air elementals are using all of it's movement and the dash action to move away from the Elder Tempest. All players on deck must make a DC 13 Dex save to avoid the Whirlwind effect from the air elementals

> _**Whirlwind (Recharge 4–6).**_ Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).
> 
> If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).


After the encounter:
* Roll a d4. that amount of air elementals become trapped within the ship during the fight. They hide themselves within crates, barrels, treasure chests, or pantries. The party may run into one from time to time, but they are mostly an annoyance

In the case of a TPK, roll for luck
* Party is rescued by a band of pirates
* Party is able to hold on to the debris of the ship
