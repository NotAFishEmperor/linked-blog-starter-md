Two nearly identical church buildings which stand side by side. One has a stained glass depiction of Lathander above its doors, while the smaller building depicts Kelemvor in its stead. The courtyard in front of it is a large public park with an elevated sundial in it's center, while the back courtyard holds a cemetery.

The rightmost church building houses Lathander's faithful, lead by [[Viviane]]. 
The leftmost chapel houses [[Lilian Carmine]], the undertaker for the cemetery and Kelemvor's faithful.
